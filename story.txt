A video is passing around and many people who watched the video died for
unclear reason. A student is curious about the story behind and decided 
to figure it out by himself. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
The student begins to investigate. They make a list of the people they know that watched the video, and those who died. Using the list, they make a plan to talk to their friends and family to find out where and when they found and watched the video.




=======
That student watched the video and promptly died, unable to discover the
mystery before meeting their untimely demise. This continued through
an array of students before one of them had the bright idea to
show it to others rather than themselves.                           Menzia
