A video is passing around and many people who watched the video died for
unclear reason. A student is curious about the story behind and decided 
to figure it out by himself. 

The student begins to investigate. They make a list of the people they know that watched the video, and those who died. Using the list, they make a plan to talk to their friends and family to find out where and when they found and watched the video.
