A video is passing around and many people who watched the video died for
unclear reason. A student is curious about the story behind and decided 
to figure it out by himself. 

That student watched the video and promptly died, unable to discover the
mystery before meeting their untimely demise. This continued through
an array of students before one of them had the bright idea to
show it to others rather than themselves.                           Menzia

His idea was to upload the video onto the popular app called tiktok. While
the student believed it was a bright idea, the video soon became popular and 
went viral. Because he knew that the video has the potential to kill who
watches the video, he never watched it. However, the billions of view he got
on his tiktok video, ultimately killed the rest of the civilization.  Seho
